        <!-- 'git add' just tells git that this is a file you
         would like to commit, and updates what will be 
         committed. 'git commit' tells git to save
         the new changes made to the file(keep track of the 
         new changes made to the file).  'git pull' can be 
         used when changes have been made to the code on 
         github(either directly on github or otherwise), and
         you want to download the most recent version of the
         code on github to your computer. 
         
         'git log' can be used to view your history of git
         commits.
         'git reset' will take a current state of the 
         repository, and revert it to an older state of the
         repository.
         'git reset --hard "commit hast"' will reset the code
         to the version of the code in the commit hash. 
         'git reset --hard origin/main' will reset the code
         to the current version of the code on the repository.
        
         To check the current branch being worked on, you use,
         'git branch'
         To checkout to a new branch, you use "git checkout".
         The command to checkout to a new branch would be 
         "git checkout -b 'name of new branch' ".
         To switch to a branch that already exists, you use,
         "git checkout 'name of branch' ".
