        <!-- 'git add' just tells git that this is a file you
         would like to commit, and updates what will be 
         committed. 'git commit' tells git to save
         the new changes made to the file(keep track of the 
         new changes made to the file).  'git pull' can be 
         used when changes have been made to the code on 
         github(either directly on github or otherwise), and
         you want to download the most recent version of the
         code on github to your computer. -->
